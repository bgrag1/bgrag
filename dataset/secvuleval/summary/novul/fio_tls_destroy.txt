 Function purpose: The function "fio_tls_destroy" is designed to deallocate and release resources associated with a TLS (Transport Layer Security) context, including its reference count, ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation) list, SNI (Server Name Indication) certificates, and trust anchors, before finally freeing the memory allocated for the TLS context itself.
