 Function purpose: The function "nxp_fspi_fill_txfifo" is designed to fill the TX FIFO of an nxp_fspi controller with data from an SPI memory operation, ensuring that the data is written to the FIFO in chunks of up to 8 bytes at a time, and handling any remaining data that doesn't fit into a complete chunk.
