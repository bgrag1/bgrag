	 * functions (such as in snd_soc_register_component()).
	 *
	 * If we call snd_soc_unregister_component() in a DRM-managed

	 * Using device-managed hooks here probably leaves us open to a
	 * bunch of issues if userspace still has a handle on the ALSA
	 * device when the device is removed. However, this is mitigated
	 * by the use of drm_dev_enter()/drm_dev_exit() in the audio
	 * path to prevent the access to the device resources if it
	 * isn't there anymore.
	 *
	 * Then, the vc4_hdmi structure is DRM-managed and thus only
	 * freed whenever the last user has closed the DRM device file.
	 * It should thus outlive ALSA in most situations.
