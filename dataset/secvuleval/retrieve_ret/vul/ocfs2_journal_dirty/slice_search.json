        "description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel prior to version 5.7.3, affecting the memory management components located in mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The get_user_pages (gup) implementation, when utilized for copy-on-write pages, fails to correctly handle read operation semantics, potentially resulting in unintended write access.",
        "commit": "The vulnerability involves the `get_user_pages()` function in the Linux kernel, which can lead to ambiguous behavior when dealing with copy-on-write (COW) pages. Specifically, the function may return a page pointer that is no longer associated with the original virtual memory area (VM) due to potential COW events. This ambiguity arises because the direction and timing of COW events are undefined, and a page can be unmapped by the thread that performed the `get_user_pages()` call, especially under memory pressure.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, the kernel introduces a change to force a COW event by setting the `FOLL_WRITE` flag when `FOLL_GET` or `FOLL_PIN` is used on a COW mapping. This ensures that the page is properly isolated from other VMs, preventing unintended access or control. However, this change affects the behavior of `get_user_pages_fast()`, which now refuses to follow read-only pages due to the potential need for COW breaking, leading to slower processing in such cases.\n\nThe current semantics are as follows:\n- `__get_user_pages_fast()`: No changes; it does not break COW unless explicitly asked.\n- `get_user_pages_fast()`: Refuses to follow read-only pages, requiring the slow path for COW breaking.\n- `get_user_pages()`: Forces COW breaking for COW mappings when using `FOLL_GET` or `FOLL_PIN`.\n\nThis change aims to clarify the semantics of `get_user_pages()` and reduce the risk of subtle bugs related to COW behavior. While this addresses the ambiguity, it is noted that true shared mappings will still allow pages to change under the user, meaning `get_user_pages()` does not guarantee a \"stable\" page."

        "description": "A flaw exists in polkit versions prior to 0.116. Specifically, the implementation of the `polkit_backend_interactive_authority_check_authorization` function in polkitd enables unauthorized testing for authentication and triggering of authentication for processes owned by other users. This vulnerability could lead to a local Denial of Service (DoS) and information disclosure.",
        "commit": "**Abstracted and Generalized Description:**\n\nD-Bus clients were permitted to submit the UID of the subject of authorization checks to mitigate race conditions against UID changes, particularly in executables set-UID to root. However, this allowance enabled any client to submit an arbitrary UID, thereby bypassing checks in functions such as CheckAuthorization, RegisterAuthenticationAgent, and UnregisterAuthenticationAgent. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:\n\n- Use CheckAuthorization to trigger dialogs in the victim's session or determine if the victim has temporary authorization for certain operations.\n- Use RegisterAuthenticationAgent to interfere with the victim's authentication agent or gather information about operations requiring authorization.\n\nTo address this issue, internal functions like _polkit_unix_process_get_owner() and polkit_unix_process_get_owner() were exposed as a private polkit_unix_process_get_racy_uid__(), explicitly highlighting the risks associated with relying on these functions. This change was implemented in polkit_backend_session_monitor_get_user_for_subject() to return a boolean indicating whether the subject UID can be chosen by the caller. In permission checks requiring the subject to match the caller, the system now fails if the UID is caller-chosen, except for root or root-designated server processes that can still request information about arbitrary subjects."
